## Hi there 👋

I'm a Computer Engineering Master's student with a strong focus on **embedded systems, sensor networks, and real-time data pipelines**. I enjoy working close to the hardware while still caring deeply about system architecture and scalability.

---

### 🔬 Current Focus
- 🌱 Coursework:
  - **COMPE 662 – Wireless Sensor Networks**
  - **EE 558 – Digital Communications**
  - **EE 658 - Advanced Digital Signal Processing**
- 🧠 Deepening my understanding of:
  - Sensor interfacing & calibration  
  - Low-latency communication stacks
  - Digital Signal Processing
  - Routing schemes for constrained and distributed systems  

---

### 🛠️ Technical Interests
- **Embedded Systems & Embedded Linux**
- **Wireless Sensor Networks & Networking Protocols**
- **Robotics & Perception**
- **Machine Learning (applied, systems-oriented)**
- **Virtual platforms & simulation for embedded systems**

---

### 🚀 Projects & Hands-On Work
- 🧭 **3D Mapping from 2D LiDAR**  
  Expanding a 2D RPLIDAR setup into 3D using servo-driven actuation, ROS 2, OctoMap, and an NVIDIA Orin Nano. Focused on perception pipelines and real-time mapping constraints.

- 📡 **Sensor & Networking Stack (Master’s Project)**  
  Designing and implementing a **sensor-to-network stack** that interfaces with hardware sensors and delivers **real-time packets of critical data**, with emphasis on reliability, latency, and scalability in a linux kernel.

- 🎮 **Systems-Driven Game Development**  
  Built a 2048-style game using SpriteKit, emphasizing clean data models, state transitions, and animation orchestration.

---

### 🔍 What I Like Working On
- Systems that bridge **hardware ↔ software**
- Problems where **timing, bandwidth, and power** actually matter
- Architectures that can evolve from prototype to deployment
- Open-ended technical challenges rather than “toy” problems

---

### 🤝 Collaboration
I’m interested in collaborating on:
- Embedded or robotics projects (ROS/ROS 2 especially)
- Sensor networks or edge-compute systems
- Simulation / virtual platform work for embedded systems
